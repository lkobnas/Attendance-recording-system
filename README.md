## About the Project
Tired of taking attendance by hand? This project will surely help you out! PunchIN is a real-time raspberry Pi project which aims to simplify the process of taking attendance by introducing a smart device. It not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and reduces the chance of manual errors. This system eliminates the need for manual signatures and allows students to mark their attendance in just a few seconds.
